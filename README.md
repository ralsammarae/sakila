## Investigating the Sakila Database
In this project, I used SQL to query the Sakila DVD Rental database. To gain a deeper understanding of the customer base, I wrote code to determine patterns in movie watching across different customer groups, how they compare in payment amounts, and how the stores in turn compare in their performance.

## Database
The ER diagram and rental database can be downloaded [here.](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-sample-database/)
